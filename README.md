# Spam_mail_prediction
In this project we are going to classify mails into spam and ham ( normal mail ) . spam mail means which contains unwanted messages and adds and so on. It will irretate to the user , therfore this model which is developed using support vector machine helps classify them into normal and spam mails. The dataset is used from kaggle website to train the model.

## Algorithm used — SVM
**About SVM**

“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is a number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well.
